OVER VIEW OF THIS PROJECT


Project:Create a Python program that acts as a basic calculator.

Key Components:
Functions for Arithmetic Operations:

add(x, y): Returns the sum of x and y.
subtract(x, y): Returns the difference between x and y.
multiply(x, y): Returns the product of x and y.
divide(x, y): Returns the quotient of x and y. Includes error handling to check if y is zero, avoiding division by zero.


Main Functionality:-
The main() function serves as the program's entry point. It:
Welcomes the user.
Prompts the user to input two numbers and handles invalid input using a try-except block.
Displays a menu for selecting an arithmetic operation.
Executes the chosen operation by calling the corresponding function and prints the result.
Handles invalid operation selections.

User Input and Interaction:-
Users are prompted to enter two numeric values and choose an operation by entering the corresponding number from the menu.
Clear error messages are displayed for invalid inputs or division by zero.

Execution Flow:-
The if __name__ == "__main__": block ensures that the main() function runs only when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.

Notable Features:
Error Handling:
Protects against invalid numeric input using try-except.
Prevents division by zero in the divide function.
Simple User Interface:

Uses print statements to guide the user through the process.
Provides immediate feedback based on user actions.
